# MIT-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

View buses moving on Route 1, near MIT and Harvard, in real time. This project takes the bus locations from the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) website, and marks them on a map from Google Maps.



**How to Run:**

For security purposes, I have removed my personal API key from line 12 of my JavaScript file. To run this application, a personal Google Cloud project will need to be set up, and a personal API key created. This API key will need to be copied and pasted into the code, in place of the text, "YOURAPIKEYHERE." This application can then be run in a web browser.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

In the future, I would like experiment with applying this application to buses local to me, in the Minneapolis area.
